          Saladmaster has changed lives one nutritious meal at a time, rising
          from humble origins in 1946 to become the pioneer in cookware
          innovation. Our founder, Harry Lemmons, began the company with a
          simple salad cutting machine. The original Saladmaster Machine's
          brilliant design and outstanding functionality were so favorably
          appreciated that it became a midcentury American kitchen classic. The
          core notion has still to be enhanced. Saladmaster started with three
          salespeople and grew to over 100 Independent Distributors in the first
          year. Currently, we have over 28,000 Independent Authorized Dealers
          and Cooking Coaches globally. Saladmaster is a proud member of the
          Direct Selling Association (DSA) and one of the longest-running direct
          sales organizations.
